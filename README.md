# Energy usage data streams with consent of device owner Proof of Concept

Sharing high frequency smart meter data with explicit consent of the consumer will help the energy transition in the Netherlands. This Alliander R&D project investigates the use of the distributed ledger IOTA and Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) for decentralized energy data streams adhering to the GDPR privacy regulation.

## Goals

- User is in control of his data
- A level playing field is created where service providers (e.g., app developers) can use the data
- Adheres to GDPR by asking for goal and consent
- Decentralized consent management via [IOTA MAM](docs/technologies#IOTA-MAM)
- Post-quantum cryptography (signing via [IOTA Kerl](docs/techologies#IOTA) and asymmetric encryption via [NTRU](docs/techologies#NTRU))

## Components

![architecture overview](docs/assets/component-diagram-without-mam.png)

* Smart Meter: Dutch Smart Meter with a high frequency energy data port (P1 port).
* [Service Provider Wattt Insights](service-provider): An example of a service provider that graphs energy usage data and interfaces with My Home.
* [Raspberry Pi energy data reader](raspberry-pi-client): A Raspberry Pi that is connected to a Dutch smart meter's P1 port (with high frequence energy data) via a USB to RJ11 cable.
* [My Home](my-home): A frontend that interfaces with the IOTA backend where users can:
  1. Pair with one Raspberry Pi
  1. Give consent for service provider to access data
  1. Revoke consent of service provider to access data

## Cloning

```
git clone git@github.com:Alliander/decentralized-auth.git
cd decentralized-auth
```

## Running locally

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install). Then run:

```
docker-compose up
```

See the separate projects's READMEs for information on running the components individually.

## Production

Run the [raspberry-pi-client](raspberry-pi-client) on a Raspberry Pi connected with a smart meter using a PJ11 cable.  
Deploy [my-home](my-home/backend). An example runs at [www.iotahome.nl](www.iotahome.nl).  
Deploy [service-provider](service-provider/backend). An example runs at [www.wattt.nl](www.wattt.nl).
